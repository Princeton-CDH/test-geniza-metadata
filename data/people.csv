He was a dyer and seller of purple textiles and exported purple textiles to North Africa and al-Andalus; he ultimately expanded his business into other fine textiles as well as Mediterranean and Indian Ocean goods. He traveled repeatedly to Upper Egypt and the Red Sea coast. 

ʿArūs had a long-term business partnership with Sibāʿ al-Lādhiqī. Having no sons of his own, he took on his sister's son ʿAllān b. Ḥassūn as a junior business partner, and married ʿAllān b. Ḥassūn to one of his daughters. ʿAllān returned the patronage by calling ʿArūs father and himself his offspring. ʿArūs had another nephew, his brother's son Yosef. 

ʿArūs was also an inveterate writer of accounts and maker of lists and tables, often on the back of letters he had received. The only documents we have in ʿArūs's hand are accounts; all the other documents in his dossier are letters to him or legal documents mentioning him.",2,113,al-Mahdiyya,Fustat,Alexandria,https://test-geniza.cdh.princeton.edu/people/arus-b-yosef/

Nahray b. Nissim,Abū Yaḥyā,Male,Jewish communal official,1040–10 November 1108 CE,,"Abū Yaḥyā Nahray b. Nissim (ca. 1025–98) was a long-distance trader in the second half of the eleventh century. The archive he or his heirs deposited into the geniza of more than 400 letters, notes, and accounts comprises one of the largest corpora of geniza sources concerning a single individual.

Born around 1025 and descended from a leader (nagid) of the Qayrawān community, Nahray migrated to Egypt around 1040, where he entered the patronage of his relative Barhūn b. Isḥaq al-Tahartī. He became central to a network of traders involved in the triangular trade between Egypt, Ifrīqiyā and Sicily. He lived briefly in Alexandria, the center of flax commerce, but eventually settled in Fustat, traveling regularly to the Maghrib and visiting Palestine at least once. 

Having studied at the Qayrawan academy of Nissim b. Ya`aqov, Nahray was learned in rabbinic literature; he acted as a professional jurisconsult in Fustat and responded to queries from North Africa. He also maintained ties to the Jerusalem academy and received two honorary titles from it. At various points, Nahray headed the Iraqi congregation in Fustat and managed the affairs of the Palestinian synagogue. He supported the Palestinian nasi David b. Daniel in his conflict with Mevorakh b. Sa'adya between 1082 and 1094, but supported Mevorakh after 1094. He also raised funds to redeem captives, in one case mobilizing the community to free Jewish merchants held by Byzantine forces in Amalfi, and served in other patronage and leadership capacities in the Jewish community.

He was still alive in 1197, as there is a writ of appointment bearing his signature from that year. Copies and originals of his letters and responsa have survived in the Firkovich and the Geniza collections. Petaḥya of Regensburg, who visited Baghdad during his gaonate, reports that he had a learned daughter who taught Bible from her home, through the window, to students who remained outside. Shemuʾel b. ʿEli entered into disputes with Maimonides, who called him “a poor old man, truthfully an ignoramus in every respect” (commentary on Mishna Bekhorot 4:4) whose authority lay solely in the titles he dispensed. Maimonides also disparaged his followers, saying that “each and every individual hangs expectantly on each word pronounced from the yeshiva in anticipation of being honored by a title” (Maimonides, Letters, ed. Baneth, 54–56). He was succeeded by his son-in-law Zekharya b. Berakhʾel (active from ca. 1194). (Information from Rustow, M. (2010). Ibn al-Dastūr, Samuel ben ʿAlī.

Philosopher, mathematician, late 10th century; he's the guy who wrote the query that produced the Iggeret Sherira Gaʾon on the redaction of the Mishnah. Author of an Arabic commentary on the Sefer Yeṣirah. Hilariously harsh on the young Saʿadya: claims that when the latter was still in Egypt, he used to address very insignificant questions to Yiṣḥaq b. Shelomo of Qayrawān and comment on medical texts (Galen?) in such a way as to reveal that actually he didn't understand them. So he decided to write his own commentary on Galen, which is still extant. Also wrote a book on Indian mathematics called Ḥisāb al-Ghubār.
